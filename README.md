# PyMovieStudio

PyMovieStudio is a Python application for making movies.

Documentation can be found on my Wiki: https://github.com/rdmilligan/PyMovieStudio/wiki

## Record movies

Plug up to four webcams into a single PC. You can now shoot a movie from multiple camera angles simultaneously!

## Edit movies

Replay the recorded movie and use speech recognition to cut between camera angles. Shout 'three' into your computer microphone and the movie switches to camera three!

## Screen movies

Watch the edited movie to your heart's content, with a big box of popcorn!
